# ESU activation with ARC

## Introduction

The aim of this repository is to facilitate the speedy activation of your Windows 2012/R2 Servers, ensuring they are prepared to receive the forthcoming Extended Security Updates (ESU).

Prior activation of your Windows 2012/R2 Servers is necessary for ESU reception. Failure to activate your servers will result in an inability to receive the ESU.

## Prerequisites

Windows 2012/R2 Server(s) already onboarded to the Azure ARC platform. Please check the [Connected Machine agent prerequisites] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/prerequisites) to ensure your servers are ready for onboarding.
